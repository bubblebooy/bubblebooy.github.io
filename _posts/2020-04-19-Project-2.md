The board game website BoardGameGeek has rating for board games based on user reviews. I created a model relating different features of a board game to its BGG rating.

### Web Scraping

Top games by number of votes were scraped from [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) using Beautiful Soup. Additional information for each game was scraped its individual BBG page with help from using Selenium. Game expansions were ignored and games published before 1900 were discarded.

### Fit

The data was fit using Linear Regression with L1 and L2 regularization values found via a grid search.
