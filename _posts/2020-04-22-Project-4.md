I looked at the discussion on a tv shows subreddit following the premiere date of each episode of the show.
I was looking to determine if there was a relationship between the discussion of an episode and the rating of that episode.

### The Data

<p> Using the ![pushshift.io 3rd party API for reddit](https://pushshift.io/) I got the top (by score) 100 Reddit posts between 1 and 3 days after an episode premiered from the shows subreddit </p>
<p> I also got Information about each episode from ![The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and scraped rating from ![Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) </p>
