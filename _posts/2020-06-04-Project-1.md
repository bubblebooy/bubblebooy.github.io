[Project Description](https://github.com/bubblebooy/chi20_ds14/blob/master/curriculum/project-01/project-01-introduction/project_01.md)

We developed a plan to help WTWY reach as many people as possible during their street outreach. Further how to target people more likely to attend their gala and donate.

We started by finding the top ten stations by average daily ridership during May 2019.
