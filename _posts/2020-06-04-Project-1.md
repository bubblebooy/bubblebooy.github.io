[Project Description](https://github.com/bubblebooy/chi20_ds14/blob/master/curriculum/project-01/project-01-introduction/project_01.md)

We developed a plan to help WTWY reach as many people as possible during their street outreach. Further how to target people more likely to attend their gala and donate.

We started by finding the top ten stations by average daily ridership during May 2019.

Next we looked at the difference in ridership on the weekend vs weekday for our top 10 stations. We can use this to try and target station with more local New Yorkers instead of tourists.
